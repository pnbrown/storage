Now that you've thought about your community's shared struggles and learnt some new skills, it's time to take some action! Use this template to help you fill out your proposal. We invite you to change the contents of this template around and use the embedded tips and evaluation criteria to help you make a âœ¨ impact on your community.

Please leave all of the headers in your final submission, and answer each of questions we pose with a detailed explanation.

## Summary of the community's shared struggles

My community's shared struggle is feeling belonging and connectedness in an unfamiliar environment where they appear to stand out.

## What does your community look like once it's shared struggles are solved?

The vision of the community in 3 - 10 years is that our school is known for an incredible community around transfer and non-traditional engineering students.
I want it to be one of the pros for choosing our university out of any of the numerous other options. 
There is no feeling in the world like being accepted not just for who you are, but because of who you are. 
I want us to be known for helping integrate (not assimilate) students into this new environment whilst simultaneously preparing them for whatever comes next.

## Proposal

Some sample activities that could help acheive this vision are listed below:

1. Welcome bash for new students:

   Nothing says 'you' belong here like a celebration for your presence. I'd like to work with the transfer department to get the names of all the incoming engineering transfers.
   Inviting them, by name, to a party for them at the beginning of the semester to help them get their bearings is a great way to start.
   Not only will the students be engaged in a low-stress environment, they'll be introduced to people just like them and people who've previously been where they are.
   There is much to be said about representation and how much it aids in the feeling of belonging. After each event, I want to survey the attendees, both students and helpers, continually make it better for attendees.

2. Career Development Workshops:

    Whether it be new topics or refreshing old ones, students who want to be successful in their craft take opportunities to improve. 
    Holding workshops on topics of interest to these new students will help them feel heard and like they are contributing members of this new society.
    Additionally, other students will hear about these rad events and want to come as well. This further increases engagement and integration into the current student body.
    Friends with similar interests are the easiest to make. Further, I know first hand how much adversity can bring people together. Tackling difficult problems together is a wonderful way to build those bonds.

3. Mentorship program:

   I've always thought it might be nice to have a mentorship exchange. The incoming transfers and non-traditional students often bring unique life experiences to their environment.
   The traditional students bring with them an understanding of the environment that can only be gained through time spent in it. 
   Pairing students together for a mutually beneficial relationship seems like another natural way to build the bonds of friendship.
   It's important to me that these things go both ways fostering a symbiosis and not a one-way relationship that dissolves at the first difficulty. 
   

## Resources

Resources needed include space for events, funding for events, and people to think up ways to keep the community engaged. 
The space and some funding will likely be gotten through the school. I would also request funding and swag assistance from GitHub.
People engage in situations that seem familiar. GitHub is one of the most recognizable brands in software engineering. 
Leveraging the ubiquity and familiarity with the brand, we can engage more people who may not have otherwise attended.

As soon as the semester begins, I will be working hard to find a few other students and instructor to join in bringing this to fruition.
There are already communities in place for many of these groups. There are also active professional organizations on campus that cater to some of our target demographic. 
The goal will be creating another space for members of these seperate groups to come together through the interest in engineering.

## Timeline

The timeline will have to evolve as the semester begins and I am more able to project difficulties and committments. 
Roughly speaking, I will work to assemble a team by the UCSD Hackathon in October. 
The hackathon is an important goalpost because it has the potential to bring out many of those I'm keen to reach.
A soft launch can take place shortly thereafter with a kickoff party in mid-October. 
Then, depending on the schedule, we can host these workshops regularly and let the group evolve naturally.
By the start of the Spring quarter, the group should have taken form. I will work with the group to lay out a roadmap for the rest of the year paying special attention to dates important for potential transfer students visiting the university. 

## Planning for the Future

The group will be constantly going through evaluations. If we are not accomplishing our goals of making students more welcome and more a part of the university community, we have no reason to exist.
More formal reviews will happen toward the middle and end of each quarter. That will make it easier to stay on track with the visions and morale of participants.
I am loath to set too much in stone because I firmly believe these plans require the involvement of more than just me. I want to start the discussion and help facilitate, not dictate.
